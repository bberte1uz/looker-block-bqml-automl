## About this LookML Block

Use this block to design user-friendly Looker Explores that allow business users to build and evaluate BQML K-means Clustering models from the Looker UI.


## Implementation

1. Install block from Looker Marketplace
2. Update the database connection and looker temporary dataset constants in the manifest
3. Create a subfolder in the *use_case_refinements* IDE folder for your use case
4. Create a refinement of the *input_data* View for your use case
5. Create a model for your use case
6. Create an Explore in your new use case model that extends the *bqml_k_means* Explore
7. Define the JOIN between your input data and predictions in the extending Explore
